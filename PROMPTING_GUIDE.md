## The Golden Rules

### Rule 1: Start with Context

❌ **Bad:**
```
Fix the bug
```

✅ **Good:**
```
There's a bug in the authentication system where users can't log in with valid credentials. 

Context:
- Repository: myapp/backend
- File: src/auth/login.js
- Error: "Invalid credentials" even with correct password
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Framework: Express.js

Task: Find and fix the login bug. The issue is likely in the password comparison logic.
```

### Rule 2: Define Scope Explicitly

❌ **Bad:**
```
Update the API
```

✅ **Good:**
```
Update the user API endpoints to add email validation.

Scope:
- File: src/routes/users.js
- Only modify POST /api/users and PUT /api/users/:id
- Do NOT touch authentication or other routes
- Add validation using Joi schema
- Return 400 if email is invalid
```

### Rule 3: Provide Constraints

❌ **Bad:**
```
Refactor the code
```

✅ **Good:**
```
Refactor the data processing module to improve readability.

Constraints:
- Keep all existing functionality
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Don't change function signatures
- Add unit tests for new helper functions
- Use existing patterns from src/utils/helpers.js
```

### Rule 4: Include Examples

❌ **Bad:**
```
Add error handling
```

✅ **Good:**
```
Add error handling to the file upload endpoint.

Current code (src/routes/upload.js):
```javascript
app.post('/upload', (req, res) => {
  const file = req.files.file;
  fs.writeFileSync('/uploads/' + file.name, file.data);
  res.json({ success: true });
});
```

Expected behavior:
- Handle missing file: return 400 with error "No file provided"
- Handle file too large (>10MB): return 413 with error "File too large"
- Handle disk full: return 500 with error "Storage error"
- Always return JSON: { success: boolean, error?: string }

Example error response:
```json
{ "success": false, "error": "No file provided" }
```
```

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: The Scoped Request

Use this when you want to limit what the AI touches.

```markdown
Task: Add input validation to the login form

SCOPE - ONLY THESE FILES:
- src/components/LoginForm.jsx
- src/validation/auth.js (create if doesn't exist)

DO NOT TOUCH:
- Authentication logic
- Backend API
- Other components

Validation rules:
- Email must be valid format
- Password must be 8+ characters
- Show inline errors below each field
```

### Pattern 2: The Step-by-Step

Use this for complex tasks that need to be broken down.

```markdown
Task: Implement user profile page

Step 1: Create the basic component structure
- Create src/pages/Profile.jsx
- Add route in App.jsx
- Create basic layout with sections

Step 2: Add data fetching
- Fetch user data from /api/user
- Handle loading state
- Handle error state

Step 3: Add edit functionality
- Make fields editable
- Add save/cancel buttons
- Implement update API call

Step 4: Testing
- Test with different user types
- Verify error handling
- Check responsive design

PAUSE after each step and ask for confirmation before proceeding.
```

### Pattern 3: The Reference Pattern

Use this when you want the AI to follow existing patterns.

```markdown
Task: Create a new API endpoint for user preferences

Follow the exact same pattern as src/routes/users.js:
- Use the same middleware structure
- Same error handling approach
- Same response format
- Same authentication checks

Specific requirements:
- GET /api/users/:id/preferences
- PUT /api/users/:id/preferences
- Validate input using Joi (like in users.js)
- Return 404 if user not found
```

### Pattern 4: The Validation Gate

Use this when you want checkpoints.

```markdown
Task: Refactor the database layer

Before making ANY changes:
1. Read and summarize the current implementation
2. Identify all files that will be affected
3. List potential risks
4. Propose a rollback strategy

After I approve:
5. Make the changes
6. Run tests
7. Verify no regressions

Do NOT proceed past step 4 without my explicit approval.
```

### Pattern 5: The Context-Rich

Use this when the task needs lots of background.

```markdown
Task: Fix the caching issue in the product catalog

BACKGROUND:
We're experiencing cache stampede during flash sales. When a popular product's cache expires, multiple requests hit the database simultaneously, causing slowdowns.

CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION:
- File: src/services/cache.js
- Uses Redis with 5-minute TTL
- No locking mechanism
- Cache key: product:${id}

PROPOSED SOLUTION:
Implement cache warming with stale-while-revalidate pattern:
1. Serve stale data while refreshing in background
2. Add probabilistic early expiration
3. Implement request coalescing

REFERENCES:
- Similar implementation: src/services/userCache.js
- Redis docs: https://redis.io/docs/manual/patterns/

ACCEPTANCE:
- Load test shows <100ms response time during cache miss
- No database connection spikes
- Graceful degradation when Redis is down
```

---

## Advanced Techniques

### Technique 1: Progressive Disclosure

Start simple, add complexity only if needed.

```markdown
Initial Task: Create a simple user registration form

If validation passes, also:
- Add email verification
- Implement rate limiting
- Add CAPTCHA for suspicious IPs

But ONLY do the extras if the basic form works perfectly.
```

### Technique 2: Constraint Programming

Define what NOT to do explicitly.

```markdown
Task: Optimize the search query

CONSTRAINTS - NEVER DO:
- Don't use raw SQL (use ORM)
- Don't remove existing indexes
- Don't change the API response format
- Don't break pagination
- Don't ignore security (always use parameterized queries)

MUST DO:
- Add database query logging
- Keep response time under 200ms
- Handle empty results gracefully
- Maintain backward compatibility
```

### Technique 3: Example-Driven

Show exactly what you want.

```markdown
Task: Add a new component for user cards

Here's the EXACT pattern to follow (from src/components/ProductCard.jsx):

```jsx
const ProductCard = ({ product }) => {
  return (
    <Card>
      <Card.Header>
        <h3>{product.name}</h3>
      </Card.Header>
      <Card.Body>
        <p>{product.description}</p>
        <Badge>{product.category}</Badge>
      </Card.Body>
    </Card>
  );
};
```

Now create UserCard following this EXACT same structure, just with user data instead of product data.
```

### Technique 4: Hypothetical Reasoning

Ask the AI to think through scenarios.

```markdown
Task: Implement a payment retry mechanism

Before coding, walk through these scenarios:

Scenario 1: Network timeout
- What should happen?
- How many retries?
- What's the backoff strategy?

Scenario 2: Insufficient funds
- Should we retry?
- What error message?

Scenario 3: Duplicate payment attempt
- How do we detect it?
- How do we prevent it?

After analyzing, implement the solution that handles all three.
```

### Technique 5: Role Play

Set a specific persona for better results.

```markdown
You are a senior security engineer with 10 years of experience.

Task: Review this authentication code for security vulnerabilities.

Approach:
- Think like an attacker
- Look for OWASP Top 10 issues
- Consider edge cases
- Question every assumption

Code to review:
[code here]

Provide:
1. List of vulnerabilities found
2. Severity rating for each
3. Suggested fixes with code examples
4. Any additional security recommendations
```

## Examples by Use Case

### Use Case 1: API Development

```markdown
Task: Create REST API endpoints for a blog

SCOPE:
- Base path: /api/v1/posts
- Files: src/routes/posts.js (new)

ENDPOINTS:

GET /api/v1/posts
- Query params: page, limit, sort
- Returns: { posts: [], total: number, page: number }
- Pagination: default 20 items per page

GET /api/v1/posts/:id
- Returns: { post: { id, title, content, author, created_at } }
- 404 if not found

POST /api/v1/posts
- Body: { title: string (required), content: string (required) }
- Validation: title min 5 chars, content min 50 chars
- Returns: { post: { id, ... } }
- 400 if validation fails with error details

PUT /api/v1/posts/:id
- Body: partial update (only provided fields)
- Returns updated post
- 404 if not found

DELETE /api/v1/posts/:id
- Returns: 204 No Content
- 404 if not found

TECHNICAL:
- Use Express.js
- Use existing auth middleware from src/middleware/auth.js
- Use existing Post model from src/models/Post.js
- Follow error handling pattern from src/routes/users.js
- Add tests in tests/routes/posts.test.js
```

### Use Case 2: Frontend Component

```markdown
Task: Create a reusable Modal component

- title: string
- children: ReactNode
- size: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large' (default: 'medium')
- closeOnOverlayClick: boolean (default: true)
- showCloseButton: boolean (default: true)

Behavior:
- Click outside modal closes it (if enabled)
- ESC key closes modal
- Focus trap inside modal
- Return focus to trigger element on close
- Animate in/out (fade + scale)

Accessibility:
- aria-modal="true"
- role="dialog"
- aria-labelledby pointing to title
- Focus management

Styling:

  title="Confirm Delete"
  size="small"
>
  <p>Are you sure?</p>
  <Button onClick={handleDelete}>Delete</Button>
</Modal>
```

Files:
- Create: src/components/Modal.jsx
- Create: src/components/Modal.test.jsx
```

### Use Case 3: Database Migration

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 1: Vague Requests

```
Make it better
```

**Problem:** AI doesn't know what "better" means.

**Fix:** Be specific about what "better" looks like.

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 2: Scope Creep

```
Fix the login bug, oh and also refactor the auth system, 
and update the docs, and add tests, and maybe redesign the UI
```

**Problem:** Too many unrelated tasks in one prompt.

**Fix:** One task per prompt, or clearly separate with "AFTER THIS, we'll do X"

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 3: Assumption of Knowledge

```
Fix the auth issue
```

**Problem:** AI doesn't know which auth issue unless you tell it.

**Fix:** Provide error messages, file names, reproduction steps.

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 4: Negative Constraints Only

```
Don't break anything
```

**Problem:** AI doesn't know what "anything" means.

**Fix:** Be explicit about what to preserve: "Maintain all existing tests" "Don't change public APIs"

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 5: Missing Context

```
Add the feature
```

**Problem:** No context about what the feature should do.

**Fix:** Describe the feature, provide user stories, show examples.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "AI keeps asking me questions"

**Cause:** Not enough context provided.

**Fix:** Add more detail about what you want, include examples.

### "AI is changing files I didn't ask for"

**Cause:** Scope not clearly defined.

**Fix:** Use "SCOPE - ONLY THESE FILES:" format.

### "AI is doing things in the wrong order"

**Cause:** Steps not explicitly sequenced.

**Fix:** Number the steps: "Step 1... Step 2... Step 3..."

### "AI is ignoring my constraints"

**Cause:** Constraints buried in text.

**Fix:** Use formatting:
```
CONSTRAINTS:
- Must do X
- Must not do Y
- Must use Z pattern
```

### "AI is over-engineering"

**Cause:** Requirements too open-ended.

**Fix:** Add constraints: "Keep it simple" "Use existing patterns" "Minimal changes"

### "AI is missing edge cases"

**Cause:** Edge cases not mentioned.

**Fix:** Explicitly list edge cases: "Handle empty input" "Handle network timeout" "Handle concurrent access"

## Practice Exercise

Try rewriting this bad prompt:

```
Fix the thing
```

Into a good prompt using what you learned:

<details>
<summary>Click to see example answer</summary>

```markdown
Task: Fix the memory leak in the data processing worker

PROBLEM:
The worker process memory grows indefinitely when processing large datasets.
After ~1000 records, memory usage exceeds 2GB and the process is killed.

CURRENT CODE (src/workers/dataProcessor.js):
```javascript
async function processBatch(records) {
  for (const record of records) {
    const result = await transform(record);
    await save(result);
  }
}
```

SCOPE:
- ONLY modify src/workers/dataProcessor.js
- May create helper functions in same file
- Do NOT change the database layer
- Do NOT modify the transform function

CONSTRAINTS:
- Memory usage must stay under 500MB for 10,000 records
- Maintain current throughput (1000 records/second)
- Don't break existing tests

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- [ ] Process 10,000 records with <500MB memory
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] No memory growth over time
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved

REFERENCES:
- Similar batch processing: src/utils/batchProcessor.js
```

</details>

**Remember:** The guardrails are there to catch mistakes, but a good prompt prevents them from being needed in the first place. Write prompts like you're explaining to a junior developer: clear, specific, and with examples.
