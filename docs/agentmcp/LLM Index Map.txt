Sentinel Knowledge Graph (Index Map)Target Audience: AI Agents & LLMsPurpose: Efficient Context Retrieval.Usage: Do not read all files. Search this map for keywords, then read the specific File Path.1. Core Architecture (The "Physics")|| Concept | Keywords | File Path || System Kernel | state machine, vfs jail, interceptor, mcp server | docs/SENTINEL_CORE_ARCH.md || Threat Model | security, attack vectors, drift, injection, risks | docs/SENTINEL_THREAT_MODEL.md || Philosophy | active guardrails, agency-control, overview | docs/SENTINEL_OVERVIEW.md |2. Workflows (The "Process")| Concept | Keywords | File Path || Execution | start task, boot sequence, shutdown, loop detection | docs/workflows/SENTINEL_WORKFLOW_EXECUTION.md || Commit/Git | git, message format, squashing, branching, push | docs/workflows/SENTINEL_WORKFLOW_COMMIT.md || Testing | tdd, validation, coverage, flaky tests, unit tests | docs/workflows/SENTINEL_WORKFLOW_TESTING.md || Deployment | release, production, staging, versioning, rollback | docs/workflows/SENTINEL_WORKFLOW_DEPLOY.md || Review | pr, pull request, code review, approval, lgtm | docs/workflows/SENTINEL_WORKFLOW_REVIEW.md || Emergency | rollback, revert, disaster recovery, restore | docs/workflows/SENTINEL_WORKFLOW_ROLLBACK.md || Documentation | changelog, adr, parity, readme updates | docs/workflows/SENTINEL_WORKFLOW_DOCS.md |3. Standards (The "Law")| Concept | Keywords | File Path || API Design | rest, grpc, versioning, openapi, contracts | docs/standards/SENTINEL_STANDARD_API.md || Logging | telemetry, observability, structured logs, tracing | docs/standards/SENTINEL_STANDARD_LOGGING.md || Isolation | test vs prod, mocking, environment locking, fixtures | docs/standards/SENTINEL_STANDARD_ISOLATION.md || Secrets | credentials, pii, passwords, env vars, leakage | docs/standards/SENTINEL_STANDARD_SECRETS.md || Cost/Budget | tokens, money, finance, budget, billing | docs/standards/SENTINEL_STANDARD_COST.md |4. Language Profiles (The "Tools")| Language | File Path || Go (Golang) | docs/languages/SENTINEL_LANG_GO.md || TypeScript / Node | docs/languages/SENTINEL_LANG_TS.md || Python | docs/languages/SENTINEL_LANG_PYTHON.md || Java | docs/languages/SENTINEL_LANG_JAVA.md || Rust | docs/languages/SENTINEL_LANG_RUST.md || C# / .NET | docs/languages/SENTINEL_LANG_CSHARP.md || Generic / Other | docs/languages/SENTINEL_LANG_GENERIC.md |🤖 Agent Instructions: Updating the IndexProtocol:Trigger: Whenever you create a new markdown file in docs/.Action: You MUST append a row to the appropriate table in this file.Format: | **Concept Name** | keywords, synonyms | path/to/new/file.md |Optimization: Keep keywords lowercase and comma-separated. Use high-entropy keywords that distinguish the file from others.
